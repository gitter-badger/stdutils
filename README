                                           Utilities
This is an attempt at writing standard POSIX comformant utilities.

The goal is to be as conformant as possible with the POSIX(2008) standards.
In the implementation only POSIX library functions should be used (no GNU extensions).



Not asking for contributions, just implementing things slowly for fun on my own time.
